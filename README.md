# Cobra keycaps

This is a custom keycap design for the [Cobra computer](http://cobrasov.com).
The design is generated by a hacky Python script which parses a template file
from WASD Keyboards and generates each individual keycap design based on a
keycap template.

[`keyboard_cobra.svg`](keyboard_cobra.svg) is the resulting design.

## Components

### Keyboard template

The keyboard template, `keyboard_base.svg`, was produced from WASD Keyboards's
template file, `wasd-inkscape-104-04.20.2021.svg`.  It was produced by
following the instructions in their template to hide the "message" layout and
set the background colors for each keycap, and by creating a "Cobra" layout for
the Python script to write to.

### Keycap template

The keycap template, `template.svg`, is a jumbled mess of template objects for
the Python script to extract and use in keycap layouts.

### The Python script

There are 7 basic key layouts using different combinations of objects from the
keycap template.  The `main()` function in `mkkb.py` defines the text/color
contents of each key in each layout, maps those attributes onto objects in the
keycap template, and finally copies those objects into each individual keycap
in the keyboard template.

## Usage

`python mkkb.py`

File arguments are defined at the top of the script.
